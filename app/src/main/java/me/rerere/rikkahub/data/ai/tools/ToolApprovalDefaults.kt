/**
 * Single source of truth for which tools require user approval before they execute.
 *
 * The matching policy is "tool name in the set" — there's no per-arg gating yet (e.g. you
 * can't say "approve termux but only if the command doesn't start with rm"). When the
 * runtime decides whether to ask the user, it consults this set, then the per-conversation
 * "Allow for this chat" allow-list, then the persistent "Always Allow" allow-list (in that
 * order); the prompt only fires when none of those let it through.
 *
 * MCP-relayed tools (any name starting with `mcp__`) are gated separately at the
 * GenerationHandler level — this set covers only locally-defined tools. See
 * [requiresApproval] for the combined logic.
 *
 * If you add a new LLM-callable tool, decide:
 *   - Is it side-effecting (writes to disk, runs shell, controls hardware, posts to a
 *     remote service, manipulates UI)? → add it here.
 *   - Is it a pure read (battery, location, screenshot, list-installed-apps)? → leave it
 *     out; the user doesn't need to be interrupted for "what's the brightness".
 *
 * Privacy-sensitive READS (contacts, sms, call log) ARE in here: reading PII off the
 * device into an LLM context deserves the same friction as a write does — the secret
 * is leaving the device either way.
